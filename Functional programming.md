Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It's a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations rather than statements.

Here are some key concepts and characteristics of functional programming:

First-Class and Higher-Order Functions: In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens. This means functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables.

Pure Functions: A key concept in functional programming is the use of pure functions. These are functions that have no side effects (they do not modify any state or data outside of the function) and return the same output given the same input.

Immutability: Functional programming often emphasizes immutability, where data objects are never modified after they are created. Instead, any modification produces a new object.

Function Composition: Functions can be composed together to build more complex operations, much like how mathematical functions are composed.

Lazy Evaluation: This is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed and can also avoid repeated evaluations.

Recursion: In functional programming, recursion is often used as a primary mechanism for looping or iterating over data, in contrast to traditional for or while loops.

Pattern Matching: Many functional languages use pattern matching, which is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a more powerful version of the switch statement seen in many other languages.

Type Systems: Functional languages often feature strong, static type systems to ensure correctness in programs. Some functional languages, like Haskell, use a type system that can express very precise and complex types.

Popular functional programming languages include Haskell, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and F#. However, many modern languages that are not purely functional, like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, also support functional programming concepts.

Functional programming is particularly popular in certain problem domains, such as concurrent programming, due to its immutable data and stateless nature, which can simplify the development of parallel and distributed systems. It's also often used in academic settings for teaching algorithmic thinking and for research in programming language theory.
