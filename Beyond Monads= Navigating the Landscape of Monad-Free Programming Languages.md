 you're looking for programming languages that don't use or rely on monads, you have plenty of options, especially outside the realm of purely functional programming languages. Here are a few:

Python: A versatile, high-level language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more. Python does not use monads in its standard syntax or libraries.

Java: A widely-used, object-oriented language known for its portability across platforms. While Java can support functional programming to an extent, it does not natively use monads.

C#: Developed by Microsoft, this language is used in the .NET framework. It supports both object-oriented and functional programming but does not require the use of monads.

JavaScript: A key language for web development, used both on the client and server-side. JavaScript supports functional programming concepts but doesn't inherently include monads.

PHP: Mainly used for server-side web development. PHP does not involve monads in its standard programming practices.

C++: A powerful language known for its performance and use in system/software development, game development, and applications requiring high performance. It does not use monads.

Ruby: Known for its elegant syntax and the powerful web framework Ruby on Rails. Ruby supports functional programming but does not require monads.

Go (Golang): A language developed by Google known for its simplicity and efficiency, especially in concurrent operations. Go does not use monads.

Rust: Known for its safety and performance, used in system programming and applications where performance is critical. Rust does not rely on monads.

Each of these languages offers a different approach to programming, with their own unique features and capabilities, and none of them require the use of monads as part of their standard programming models. Monads are mostly associated with languages like Haskell, where they play a central role in handling side effects in a functional programming context.
